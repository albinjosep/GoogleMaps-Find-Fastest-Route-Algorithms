# Fastest Route Finder with BFS, Dijkstra(getting speed limit data from web) and also A Star Algorithms included.
_this was the final homework for UCSD's Advanced Data Structures in Java._

A basic shortest path finder between given two points. Dijkstra has the extra feature of getting data from web, to name it from opensourcemap, if the current coordinates does not have the info of maxspeed then continues to scan around 300 radius uses the closest info.
